# ATM Dashboard Project Using Power BI

## Introduction

This project involves creating an interactive dashboard using Power BI to analyze ATM transactions, cash withdrawals, and user behavior patterns. The dashboard provides valuable insights to financial institutions to optimize their ATM services.

## Data Overview

The project utilizes datasets containing ATM transaction data, including variables such as transaction amounts, withdrawal frequencies, and timestamps. These datasets are crucial for understanding and optimizing ATM operations.

## Research Objective

The objective of this project is to:
1. Clean and preprocess the ATM transaction datasets.
2. Develop an interactive dashboard using Power BI.
3. Perform exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and trends.
4. Provide actionable insights based on the dashboard analysis.

## Data Cleaning

The ATM transaction datasets were cleaned by:
- Removing rows with missing values.
- Eliminating duplicate entries.
- Converting timestamp columns to datetime format for accurate analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Summary Statistics

Summary statistics were calculated for the ATM transaction data to understand key characteristics and distribution.

## Observations

- **Usage Trends:** The data reveals clear trends in ATM usage, with specific periods showing higher activity.
- **Transaction Patterns:** Most transactions fall within a specific range, indicating common withdrawal behaviors.
- **Peak Periods:** Peak transaction periods can be identified, which are crucial for ATM cash replenishment planning.

## Implications

- **Resource Optimization:** Understanding peak periods helps in optimizing the replenishment schedule and ensuring ATMs are adequately stocked.
- **User Segmentation:** Analyzing user behavior assists in tailoring services and marketing efforts to different user groups.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Insights from the dashboard can lead to more efficient ATM network management, reducing downtime and improving user satisfaction.

## Suggestions

- **Enhanced Data Collection:** Collect more granular transaction data to improve the accuracy of analysis and forecasting.
- **Advanced Analysis:** Incorporate advanced analytics and machine learning models for predictive insights.
- **Integration:** Integrate ATM transaction data with other financial datasets for a more comprehensive analysis.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of creating an interactive dashboard to analyze and visualize ATM transaction data using Power BI. The insights gained from the dashboard can help financial institutions optimize their ATM operations, improve user satisfaction, and enhance operational efficiency.
